# What is Kloudlite InfraOps?

Kloudlite InfraOps is a platform developed to improve the management of Kubernetes clusters across multiple public cloud providers. It automates key processes in cluster management, aiming to make the deployment, scaling, and operational management of Kubernetes environments more efficient.

**Core Features:**

* **Built on k3s:** Kloudlite uses k3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, as its foundation for creating Kubernetes clusters. k3s is chosen for its ease of installation and compatibility with various deployment sizes, providing a balanced orchestration solution.
* **Operators Integration:** Kloudlite integrates operators to streamline the management and maintenance of clusters. These operators automate tasks related to administration and maintenance, targeting improvements in cost efficiency, resilience, scalability, and maintenance of current operations.

**Key Capabilities:**

Kloudlite is equipped with features designed to improve Kubernetes usability:

1. **WireGuard VPN Integration:** Offers a secure connection to services within Kubernetes clusters, aiming to reduce development loop times and facilitate application development.
2. **Cluster Autoscaling:** Automatically adjusts the size of nodepools based on workload demand, aiming for efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to changes.
3. **Spot Instance Management:** Enables the use of spot instances to reduce computing costs without compromising reliability, aiming for an optimal balance between cost and performance.
4. **Cloud-Specific Storage Integration:** Provides integration with storage solutions from various cloud providers, ensuring Kubernetes clusters can use the most appropriate storage options for each cloud environment.
5. **Cloud-Specific Load Balancers:** Supports the use of cloud provider-specific load balancers, intended to improve network traffic distribution and application responsiveness.

Kloudlite InfraOps focuses on facilitating the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters in a variety of public cloud environments, offering a platform that addresses the complexities of modern cloud-native deployments.
