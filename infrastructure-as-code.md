# Infrastructure As Code

<mark style="color:red;">This feature is still work in progress. Will soon update with cli tools necessary to manage your cluster declaratively.</mark>



**Work in Progress**

**------**

Kloudlite clusters are created and managed using kubernetes operators. We can declaratively create and update your clusters as any kubernetes resources.

You can refer to our [API reference](references/api-reference.md) for complete list of resources supported.



You can use our cli to create and manage your clusters with ease.

**Example:**

**HA Cluster with 1 autoscaling NodePool**

```
// Some code
```

**Development Cluster with spot instance pool**

```
// Some code
```
